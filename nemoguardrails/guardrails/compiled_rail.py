"""Manifest-driven rail execution for IORails.

A ``CompiledRail`` is the executable unit behind one configured flow string. It is built
once, at engine construction. It resolves the flow's ``RailSurface`` from the manifest
catalog, imports the library action the surface declares, and freezes a plan for filling
that action's parameters. Thereafter each request is one ``await action(**kwargs)`` and
the returned ``RailOutcome`` is passed back to the caller unchanged.
